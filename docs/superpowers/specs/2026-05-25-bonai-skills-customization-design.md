# Bonai Skills — Customization & Tessl Publishing Design

**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Owner:** Jay Feng (jayfeng0625@gmail.com)
**Workspace:** `bonai-dev`
**Status:** Approved through brainstorming; ready for implementation planning.

---

## 1. Goal

Tailor the 14 engineering and productivity skills inherited from `mattpocock/skills` into a personal, ambiguity-free set, packaged as **two versioned tessl tiles** under the `bonai-dev` workspace. The set is intended to **replace** the `superpowers` skill plugin over time, so each skill must stand on its own with no superpowers fallback.

## 2. Foundational decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace | `bonai-dev` | Matches existing `tessl.json` |
| Packaging | Two tiles: `bonai-dev/engineering-skills`, `bonai-dev/productivity-skills` | Coarser versioning, simpler manifests than 14 per-skill tiles |
| Versioning | Calver (`2026.05.0`), private | Continuously-evolving personal set; no public commitment yet |
| Customization depth | Medium — keep Matt's names, rewrite ambiguous sections | Lowest churn; names are already outcome-shaped |
| Skill posture | Outcome-driven — skills lean on agent-led interrogation (AskUserQuestion patterns) to extract requirements and remove ambiguity rather than rigid checklists | Maximizes use of the agent to decompose problems with the user instead of prescribing flows |
| Tech stack posture | Language-agnostic | User works across TS/Node + Kotlin/JVM; skills should not assume |
| Issue tracker | Notion via Notion MCP | User's actual workflow surface |
| Superpowers relationship | Independent — no references | Bonai is intended to replace superpowers |
| Cadence | Stage 1 (5 skills) → Stage 2 (rest) | Validate Notion+commands contract before scaling |

## 3. Bucket assignment

`/handoff` moves from **productivity** to **engineering** because it requires Notion primitives (creating a page in the Handoffs DB). This keeps productivity completely independent of the tracker-primitives layer. The folder move happens in Stage 1 (§7.1 step 2), even though `/handoff`'s body customization waits until Stage 2.

**Engineering bucket (11 skills, post-reshuffle)**
`setup-bonai-skills`, `tdd`, `diagnose`, `grill-with-docs`, `prototype`, `triage`, `to-issues`, `to-prd`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `zoom-out`, `handoff`

**Productivity bucket (3 skills, post-reshuffle)**
`caveman`, `grill-me`, `write-a-skill`

Per the staged cadence (§7), Stage 1 publishes **only the engineering tile** with **5 skills in its manifest**. The remaining engineering skills (in the repo but excluded from the manifest) and the productivity tile (not scaffolded yet) are added in Stage 2.

## 4. The contract: how skills talk to Notion

### 4.1 Layers

```
Skill body (abstract verbs)
        │
        ▼
tracker-primitives/notion.md  ← MCP recipes (shipped with the tile)
        │
        ▼
docs/agents/notion.md         ← Per-repo IDs & property mappings (written by /setup-bonai-skills)
        │
        ▼
Notion MCP tool calls         ← Concrete invocations
```

Skills only know **abstract verbs**. The tile-shipped `tracker-primitives/notion.md` translates each verb into MCP calls. The per-repo `docs/agents/notion.md` supplies the concrete IDs and property name mappings.

### 4.2 Controlled vocabulary of abstract verbs

| Verb | Used by |
|---|---|
| `transition state` | `/triage` |
| `post triage note` | `/triage` |
| `create issue page` | `/to-issues`, `/triage` |
| `create PRD page` | `/to-prd` |
| `create handoff page` | `/handoff` |
| `read glossary` | `/tdd`, `/diagnose`, `/grill-with-docs`, `/triage`, `/to-issues`, `/to-prd`, `/improve-codebase-architecture` |
| `write glossary entry` | `/grill-with-docs`, `/improve-codebase-architecture` |
| `read ADRs in area` | `/tdd`, `/diagnose`, `/grill-with-docs`, `/triage`, `/improve-codebase-architecture` |
| `create ADR` | `/grill-with-docs`, `/improve-codebase-architecture` |

Skills must not introduce new verbs without updating this list and the primitives files.

### 4.3 The 5 Notion databases

1. **Issues DB** — work items
2. **PRDs DB** — product requirements documents
3. **Handoffs DB** — cross-session handoff pages
4. **Domain Glossary DB** — replaces repo `CONTEXT.md`
5. **ADRs DB** — replaces repo `docs/adr/`

### 4.4 Per-repo configuration

`/setup-bonai-skills` writes:

- `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`): a minimal `## Agent skills` block pointing to the two config files
- `docs/agents/commands.md`: `test_command`, `lint_command`, `typecheck_command`, `build_command` — asked once at setup time, cached per repo (no per-run detection)
- `docs/agents/notion.md`: workspace ID, 5 DB IDs, property→canonical-role mappings

**Example `docs/agents/notion.md`:**

```markdown
# Notion config

## Workspace
ID: <workspace-id>

## Databases
Issues DB:           <id>
PRDs DB:             <id>
Handoffs DB:         <id>
Domain Glossary DB:  <id>
ADRs DB:             <id>

## Issues DB properties
Status (status):
  needs-triage     → "needs-triage"
  needs-info       → "needs-info"
  ready-for-agent  → "ready-for-agent"
  ready-for-human  → "ready-for-human"
  wontfix          → "wontfix"
Category (select):
  bug              → "bug"
  enhancement      → "enhancement"
Blocked by: relation → Issues DB
```

### 4.5 .out-of-scope/ — stays in repo

The `.out-of-scope/*.md` knowledge base (used by `/triage` to avoid re-suggesting rejected enhancements) stays as repo files. It's an append-only set of repo-local rejections — flat and versioned with code.

### 4.6 Format files

`CONTEXT-FORMAT.md`, `ADR-FORMAT.md`, `AGENT-BRIEF.md`, `OUT-OF-SCOPE.md` become **page-body templates only** — what goes inside a Notion page body. DB schemas (properties) live in `docs/agents/notion.md`. The setup skill uses these as seed skeletons.

## 6. Per-skill customization plan

### 6.1 Stage 1 (v2026.05.0)

#### `setup-bonai-skills` (renamed from `setup-matt-pocock-skills`)

- Promote Notion from "Other → freeform" to first-class default.
- Drop GitHub/GitLab branches from the primary flow; keep them as references under `tracker-primitives/`.
- New section **Commands**: ask the user once per repo for `test_command`, `lint_command`, `typecheck_command`, `build_command` and cache the answers in `docs/agents/commands.md`. May surface candidate defaults from `package.json` / `build.gradle` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` as inference hints, but the user's answer is authoritative — no silent detection.
- New section **Notion**: ask for 5 DB IDs + property mappings, write `docs/agents/notion.md`. Optionally offer to create missing DBs from seed schemas if user grants Notion MCP write access.
- Drop the Domain Docs file-layout question (CONTEXT.md and ADRs moved to Notion).
- Keep `disable-model-invocation: true` (user-invoked only).

#### `tdd`

- Replace "use the project's domain glossary" with abstract verb **`read glossary`**.
- Add explicit references to `docs/agents/commands.md` for `test_command` and `typecheck_command` wherever the skill body would otherwise need to name a runner. The skill body must never mention vitest/jest/pytest/junit/etc. by name.
- Audit supporting files (`tests.md`, `mocking.md`, `deep-modules.md`, `interface-design.md`, `refactoring.md`) for vitest/jest/etc. leakage and neutralize.

#### `diagnose`

- Replace "domain glossary" / "check ADRs" with abstract verbs (`read glossary`, `read ADRs in area`).
- Phase 5 regression-test command → defer to `commands.md`.
- Bundle `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` referenced in Phase 1 (verify existence; create if missing).

#### `grill-with-docs`

- Replace inline writes to `CONTEXT.md` / `docs/adr/` with abstract verbs (`write glossary entry`, `create ADR`).
- Repurpose `CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` + `ADR-FORMAT.md` as Notion page-body templates.
- Drop the `CONTEXT-MAP.md` / multi-context branching (Notion DBs are flat; no per-context glossary).

#### `prototype`

- No skill-body changes. User confirmed the existing skill already addresses both branches relevant to their workflow: state/logic prototypes (terminal app) and divergent UI variations (HTML routes). The Opus-4.7-driven interactive prototype and static-HTML-mockup use cases the user mentioned in Round 1 are covered by the existing UI branch.
- Verify `LOGIC.md` and `UI.md` supporting files exist.

### 6.2 Stage 2 (later)

#### `triage`

- Biggest rewrite. Replace "apply label" / "post comment" verbiage with abstract verbs (`transition state`, `post triage note`).
- Strip `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` reference → `/setup-bonai-skills`.
- Audit `AGENT-BRIEF.md` + `OUT-OF-SCOPE.md` — keep as page-body templates.
- Keep `.out-of-scope/` as repo files.

#### `to-issues`

- Swap "publish to issue tracker" → abstract verb `create issue page`.
- Dependency relations → Notion `Blocked by` relation property.

#### `to-prd`

- Swap target → `create PRD page` in PRDs DB.
- Stays no-interview (synthesizes existing context).

#### `improve-codebase-architecture`

- Abstract verbs for glossary/ADR reads/writes.
- HTML report unchanged (already self-contained, written to `$TMPDIR`).
- Audit `LANGUAGE.md`, `HTML-REPORT.md`, `INTERFACE-DESIGN.md`.
- Fix cross-skill refs to `../grill-with-docs/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` (works inside one tile).

#### `zoom-out`

- Start as a 1-liner skill that loads supporting refs (modules map, callers index) when invoked. Stays close to today's terse shape.
- Evolution path toward a full workflow: use Agent(Explore) to walk the codebase, map modules + callers, render the result as a tree, and name unfamiliar terms against the Notion Domain Glossary DB. Progress from 1-liner → full workflow as friction emerges, not on a fixed schedule.

#### `handoff` (moved to engineering)

- Fixed-template Notion page in Handoffs DB.
- Sections: **Goal / What's done / Open questions / Suggested skills / Key files / Sensitive-info note**.
- Abstract verb: `create handoff page`.

#### `caveman` (productivity)

- No changes.

#### `grill-me` (productivity)

- Scope explicitly: **non-code grilling** — design/strategy/plans/talks with no codebase to read against.
- Make the non-overlap with `/grill-with-docs` explicit in the body.

#### `write-a-skill` (productivity)

- Stays tile-agnostic — produces a skill folder, not a tessl manifest entry.
- Audit for outdated guidance; align with bonai SKILL.md conventions.

### 6.3 Cross-cutting hygiene

- Verify every referenced supporting file exists in each skill folder.
- Strip every `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` reference → `/setup-bonai-skills`.
- Strip any GitHub-first phrasing in skill bodies; replace with abstract verbs.
- Rewrite top-level `README.md` (bonai branding, two-tile structure, Notion-first defaults).
- Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for new bucket distribution (handoff moves to engineering).
- Update each bucket's `README.md` to match the new skill list.

## 7. Tessl publish sequence

### 7.1 Stage 1 (engineering tile only — v2026.05.0)

1. **Scaffold the engineering tile.** `mcp__tessl__new_tile` for `bonai-dev/engineering-skills` (private). Productivity tile is not scaffolded in Stage 1.
2. **Reshuffle.** Move `skills/productivity/handoff/` → `skills/engineering/handoff/`. Update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + bucket READMEs. The handoff folder is moved but its body is not customized in Stage 1.
3. **Land `tracker-primitives/`.** Create `notion.md`, `gh.md`, `local.md` with abstract-verb recipes (full set, even though Stage 1 skills only exercise a subset of verbs — establishes the pattern).
4. **Customize the 5 Stage 1 skills** per Section 6.1: `setup-bonai-skills`, `tdd`, `diagnose`, `grill-with-docs`, `prototype`.
5. **Audit supporting files** for each Stage 1 skill.
6. **Local validation.** Install engineering tile into a scratch repo via `tessl install`; run `/setup-bonai-skills` against a test Notion workspace; run `/tdd` and `/diagnose` against a sample project.
7. **Publish engineering tile at v2026.05.0.** Manifest includes only the 5 customized Stage 1 skills. Remaining engineering skills present in the repo are excluded from the manifest until Stage 2.

### 7.2 Stage 2 (later — v2026.XX.0)

- Customize the 6 remaining engineering skills.
- Add them to the engineering tile manifest; publish engineering tile at v2026.XX.0.
- Scaffold the productivity tile via `mcp__tessl__new_tile`.
- Customize the 3 productivity skills.
- Publish productivity tile at v2026.XX.0 (XX = publish month; same calver as engineering bump).

## 8. Acceptance criteria

Stage 1 is done when:

- [ ] `mcp__tessl__status` shows `bonai-dev/engineering-skills` in sync at `2026.05.0`.
- [ ] `tessl install bonai-dev/engineering-skills@2026.05.0` in a scratch repo succeeds.
- [ ] `/setup-bonai-skills` in a scratch repo produces a valid `docs/agents/commands.md` and `docs/agents/notion.md`.
- [ ] `/tdd` in the scratch repo runs without referring to vitest/jest by name and uses commands from `docs/agents/commands.md`.
- [ ] `/diagnose` Phase 5 uses `commands.md` for the regression-test command.
- [ ] `/grill-with-docs` writes glossary entries to the Domain Glossary DB and ADRs to the ADRs DB (not to repo files).
- [ ] `/prototype` runs unchanged.
- [ ] Every Stage 1 customized skill body contains zero references to `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `matt-pocock`, `gh issue`, or specific test runners by name.
- [ ] The engineering tile manifest at v2026.05.0 contains exactly the 5 Stage 1 skills — uncustomized engineering skills in the repo are excluded from the manifest.

## 9. Open items deferred to implementation

- Exact `tile.json` schema — defer to whatever `mcp__tessl__new_tile` scaffolds. The spec assumes the scaffold accepts a list of skills and a calver string; if the actual schema differs, the implementation plan will adapt.
- **Default Issues DB property shape.** The original Round 4 question about state-machine→property mapping (Status-only vs Status+Category vs multi-select labels vs probe-schema) was dropped when the user re-asked Round 4 with baseline context. The §4.4 example assumes **Status + Category** as the default seed, but the property shape is ultimately user-supplied during `/setup-bonai-skills`. If the user prefers a different default (e.g. multi-select Labels for closer GitHub parity), call it out during implementation and the spec/example will be updated.

## 10. Out of scope

- Skills under `misc/`, `personal/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/` — these stay as-is.
- Public-facing tessl publishing — tiles remain private throughout both stages.
- A separate `bonai-dev/tracker-primitives` tile — keeping primitives inside the engineering tile is simpler at this scale.
- Migration tooling to move existing repo `CONTEXT.md` / `docs/adr/` content into Notion DBs — manual one-time activity per repo.
