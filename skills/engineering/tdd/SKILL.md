name: tdd
description: Implements features or fixes bugs by writing a failing test first (red), making it pass with minimal code (green), then refactoring — driving design through external behavior tests. Reads test/lint/build commands from the commands file named in the `## Agent skills` block so it stays language-agnostic. Use when the user says "do this TDD", "test-first", "red-green-refactor", "write the test first", "integration tests", "build with tests", or asks for test-driven development of a feature or fix.

# Test-Driven Development

> **The Iron Law:** No production code without a failing test first. If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## Core principle

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces. The warning sign of an implementation-coupled test: it breaks during refactor when behavior hasn't changed. See [tests.md](tests.md) for good/bad examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for when mocking is appropriate.

## Commands

This skill never names a test runner directly. The canonical commands live in the commands file named via `Config dir:` in the `## Agent skills` block, written by `/setup-bonai-skills`:

- Run the test suite with `test_command`.
- Run the type-checker with `typecheck_command` (if set).

If that commands file is missing, stop and ask the user to run `/setup-bonai-skills` — do not invent a command from `package.json`.

## Anti-pattern: horizontal slices

**Never write all tests first, then all implementation.** Tests written in bulk test imagined behavior — they pass when real behavior breaks. Go vertical: `test1 → impl1`, `test2 → impl2`. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle.

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, ground test names and interface vocabulary in the project's domain language, and respect documented architectural decisions. The pointers to the glossary and ADR sources live in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md under the `## Agent skills` section's **Domain language** entry, written by `/setup-bonai-skills`. If that entry is missing, the project hasn't been set up — proceed without grounding rather than guessing where the sources live.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](deep-modules.md) for internal logic — but inject collaborators (db, HTTP, clock, files); don't encapsulate them
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](interface-design.md); see [mocking.md](mocking.md) for boundary patterns and mock shape
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system end-to-end:

```python
# RED — test fails because checkout() doesn't exist yet
def test_user_can_checkout_with_valid_cart():
    cart = Cart([Item(sku="abc", price=10)])
    order = checkout(cart, payment=ValidCard())
    assert order.status == "confirmed"
    assert order.total == 10
```

Then write the minimal `checkout()` needed to turn it GREEN. Don't add the discount logic, don't add tax, don't add empty-cart handling — those are the next tests.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test
       Run test_command — confirm it fails for the right reason
       (feature missing, not typo / setup / import error)
GREEN: Minimal code to pass
       Run test_command — confirm it passes
       Other tests still pass; output pristine (no errors, warnings)
```

If RED passes immediately, the test isn't exercising the new behavior — fix the test before proceeding. If GREEN can't be reached with minimal code, the test or the design is wrong — back up rather than write speculative code.

Rules:

- One test at a time
- **One logical assertion per test.** A test pins down one behavior. Asserting one outcome may take a couple of physical asserts (e.g. `order.status` and `order.total` both describe "a confirmed order"), but never bundle unrelated behaviors into one test — split "rejects empty cart" and "applies discount" into separate tests so a failure names exactly what broke.
- **Name the test after the behavior, not the method.** `test_rejects_checkout_when_cart_empty`, not `test_checkout_2`. The name should read as a sentence about observable behavior.
- Only enough code to pass current test — the minimal change. If you're typing logic the current test doesn't force, stop; it belongs to a later test.
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Common rationalizations

These excuses lead to skipping TDD. They are not pragmatic — they cost more downstream:

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests-after answer "what does this do?" Tests-first answer "what should this do?" Tests written after pass immediately and prove nothing. |
| "Already manually tested it" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run, easy to forget under pressure. |
| "Hard to write the test = the test is wrong" | More often: hard to test = hard to use. Listen to the test — simplify the interface. |

## Red flags — STOP and reset

Any of these means you've drifted out of TDD. Discard what you just wrote and restart the cycle from RED:

- Wrote code before the test
- Test passed on first run (you're testing existing behavior, not new behavior)
- Can't explain why the test failed
- "I'll add tests later"
- "This case is different"
- Mocking your own classes or internal collaborators

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test name describes the behavior, not the method
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test asserts one logical outcome (no unrelated behaviors bundled)
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test — nothing the test doesn't force
[ ] No speculative features added
```
